# NBA Player Data API

This API provides endpoints to query NBA player statistics, including both "Totals" data and "Advanced" statistical data. Each endpoint supports filtering, sorting, and pagination options to help you retrieve the data you need.

[<img src="https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg" alt="Run In Postman" style="width: 128px; height: 32px;">](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/25652688-483c72bc-2588-4b7e-b9f9-30c3f5f2ebcc?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D25652688-483c72bc-2588-4b7e-b9f9-30c3f5f2ebcc%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dbb6fcb02-8388-4ce0-8623-63480a6dc153)

## Base URL

All endpoints are served from the base URL:

```
http://rest.nbaapi.com
```

## Authentication

No authentication is currently required for these endpoints.

## Endpoints Overview

- **Player Data Totals** (`/playerdatatotals`)

  Provides season-based totals such as points, assists, games played, and more.

- **Player Data Advanced** (`/playerdataadvanced`)

  Provides advanced player metrics such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER), True Shooting Percentage (TS%), Usage Percentage, Win Shares, and other advanced stats.

Both endpoints offer similar querying patterns and filtering options.

## Common Query Parameters

For both Totals and Advanced endpoints, the following query parameters are available for the `/query` routes:

- **playerName** *(string, optional)*: Filter results to players whose name matches or partially matches the provided string.
- **season** *(int, optional)*: Filter by a specific season (e.g., `2025`).
- **team** *(string, optional)*: Filter by a team abbreviation (partial matches allowed).
- **playerId** *(string, optional)*: Filter by a player's unique ID (partial matches allowed).

**Sorting Options:**

- **sortBy** *(string, optional)*: Field name to sort results by. Varies by endpoint.
- **ascending** *(bool, optional)*: Set to `true` (default) for ascending order or `false` for descending order.

**Pagination:**
- **pageNumber** *(int, optional)*: Page number to retrieve (default is 1).
- **pageSize** *(int, optional)*: Number of records per page (default is 10).

If no data matches your query, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
